"""jspace — an instrument for the J-Space skill.

It knows one thing you cannot know accurately: what state you were in a few seams
ago. It keeps that record and hands it back. It decides nothing, and it blocks
nothing.

    jspace.py seam                          the ledger, and what has and has not moved
    jspace.py note --next "..."             set the single next action
    jspace.py note --goal "..."             set what done means
    jspace.py note --core "name — one fact" add a hub entry
    jspace.py note --core "..." --core-slot 1  swap a live hub entry
    jspace.py note --check "..." --by "..." append a numbered verified checkpoint
    jspace.py note --open "..." --settled-by "..."   add an open question
    jspace.py note --close 2 --check "..." --by "..."  resolve question 2
    jspace.py ship draft.md                 register check on anything about to leave
    jspace.py resume                        premise, invariants and full ledger

Exit codes mean one thing only:

    0   it did what you asked
    2   it could not do what you asked

It never exits non-zero to stop you from working. The one thing it declines to do
is write a malformed entry into the ledger, because a ledger you cannot trust is
worse than no ledger — it looks like state.

Standard library only. No network. Writes exactly one directory: .jspace/
