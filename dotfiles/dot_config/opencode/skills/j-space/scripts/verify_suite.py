"""verify_suite — authoring-time integrity check for the J-Space skill.

Run from anywhere:  python3 <skill-root>/scripts/verify_suite.py

Checks, in order of how badly each one breaks the suite:

  1. Exactly one file in the tree carries skill frontmatter. More than one and the
     harness registers more than one command.
  2. The J-Space Premise is byte-identical in SKILL.md and in all nine modules.
     Verbatim recurrence is the repetition schedule; a paraphrase silently
     disables it.
  3. Every module and reference is present and reachable from the entry file.
  4. No version talk anywhere in the skill text. The text addresses the model,
     never the maintainer.
  5. Every module carries a drill with a pass and a fail criterion.
  6. All nine modules carry the same backbone sections, in the same order.
     Extra sections between them are allowed and expected — that is where a
     module says what it is rather than what to do. What must not vary is the
     spine, so every module is navigable the same way.

Exit 0 clean, 1 with findings. Standard library only.
